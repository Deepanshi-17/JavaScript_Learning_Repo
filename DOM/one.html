<!--You can visit brendan eich wikipedia page and open the console. write console.log(windows), 
you will get windows object. Now, do, console.log(document) then you will get document property 
stored in windows object which is accessible via windows.document but as it is very common hence, 
can be accessed directly by console.log(windows). Also this document will only have HTML file no 
other property. If you want all the property then console.dir(document) then you will get all the 
property -->

<!-- Other methods on document
 console.log(document.baseURI);      Gives base URL of the web page
 console.log(document.links)   Gives all the link present in the web page (Links list will be given in the form of HTML collection not arrays, hence, the properties of arrays won't be available here.)

 Selecting any element
 document.getElementbyId('firstHeading')
 //Output-> it will get the entire tag of h1 having id == 'firstHeading'. This is called as DOM Manipulation

 document.getElementById.('firstHeading').innerHTML = "<H1>Chai or code</H1>"
